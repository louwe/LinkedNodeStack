# LinkedNodeStack
This is a Stack that is implemented using a LinkedList.
This initial implementation does not actually allocate memory space. Rather, it simply stores references to objects that already have been allocated.
Users are responsible for allocation and retention of the objects. The stack simply keeps track of the order of the nodes.
